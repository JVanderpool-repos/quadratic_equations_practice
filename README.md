## üìñ Mathematical Background

### Quadratic Equations
The application generates quadratic equations of the form:
```
ax¬≤ + bx + c = 0
```

Where:
- **a = 1** (simplified for educational purposes)
- **b and c** are calculated from two random integer roots
- **Roots** are integers between -10 and 10

The relationship used:
- If roots are r‚ÇÅ and r‚ÇÇ, then the equation is: `(x - r‚ÇÅ)(x - r‚ÇÇ) = 0`
- Expanding: `x¬≤ - (r‚ÇÅ + r‚ÇÇ)x + (r‚ÇÅ √ó r‚ÇÇ) = 0`

### Slope-Intercept Form
The application generates linear equations of the form:
```
y = mx + b
```

Where:
- **m** is the slope (integers between -10 and 10)
- **b** is the y-intercept (integers between -10 and 10)
- The equation represents a line with:
  - Rate of change = m (rise/run)
  - Point of intersection with y-axis = (0, b)

## üé® Customization

### Quadratic Equations
Modify the difficulty by adjusting the root generation in `assets/js/app.js`:
```javascript
// Current: roots between -10 and 10
this.root1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10;

// Easy: roots between -5 and 5
this.root1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 11) - 5;

// Hard: roots between -20 and 20
this.root1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 41) - 20;
```

### Slope-Intercept Form
Adjust the difficulty by modifying value ranges in `assets/js/slope-intercept.js`:
```javascript
// Current: values between -10 and 10
this.slope = Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10;

// Easy: values between -5 and 5
this.slope = Math.floor(Math.random() * 11) - 5;

// Hard: values between -20 and 20
this.slope = Math.floor(Math.random() * 41) - 20;
```
