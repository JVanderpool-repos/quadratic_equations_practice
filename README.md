   git clone https://github.com/JVanderpool-repos/quadratic-equations-practice.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd quadratic-equations-practice
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser

### Option 2: Live Server (Recommended for Development)
1. Install a live server extension in VS Code or use Node.js live-server:
   ```bash
   npm install -g live-server
   live-server
   ```

### Option 3: GitHub Pages
This project is configured for GitHub Pages deployment. Simply fork the repository and enable Pages in your repository settings.

## üéØ Usage

1. **View the Equation**: A random quadratic equation appears in the format `ax¬≤ + bx + c = 0`
2. **Enter Roots**: Input the two roots (x‚ÇÅ and x‚ÇÇ) in the provided fields
3. **Check Answer**: Click "Check Answer" or press Enter after the second input
4. **Get Feedback**: 
   - ‚úÖ Correct answers advance to the next problem
   - ‚ùå Incorrect answers provide hints and explanations
5. **Track Progress**: Your score increases with each correct answer

## üìñ Mathematical Background

The application generates quadratic equations of the form:
```
ax¬≤ + bx + c = 0
```

Where:
- **a = 1** (simplified for educational purposes)
- **b and c** are calculated from two random integer roots
- **Roots** are integers between -10 and 10

The relationship used:
- If roots are r‚ÇÅ and r‚ÇÇ, then the equation is: `(x - r‚ÇÅ)(x - r‚ÇÇ) = 0`
- Expanding: `x¬≤ - (r‚ÇÅ + r‚ÇÇ)x + (r‚ÇÅ √ó r‚ÇÇ) = 0`

## üé® Customization

### Difficulty Levels
To modify the difficulty, adjust the root generation in `script.js`:
```javascript
// Current: roots between -10 and 10
root1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10;

// Easy: roots between -5 and 5
root1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 11) - 5;

// Hard: roots between -20 and 20
root1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 41) - 20;
```

### Styling
The project uses Tailwind CSS. Modify classes in `index.html` or add custom CSS for personalization.
