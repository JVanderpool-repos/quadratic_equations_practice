   live-server
   ```

### Option 3: GitHub Pages
This project is configured for GitHub Pages deployment. Simply fork the repository and enable Pages in your repository settings.

## 🎯 Usage

1. **View the Equation**: A random quadratic equation appears in the format `ax² + bx + c = 0`
2. **Enter Roots**: Input the two roots (x₁ and x₂) in the provided fields
3. **Check Answer**: Click "Check Answer" or press Enter after the second input
4. **Get Feedback**: 
   - ✅ Correct answers advance to the next problem
   - ❌ Incorrect answers provide hints and explanations
5. **Track Progress**: Your score increases with each correct answer

## 📖 Mathematical Background

The application generates quadratic equations of the form:
```
ax² + bx + c = 0
```

Where:
- **a = 1** (simplified for educational purposes)
- **b and c** are calculated from two random integer roots
- **Roots** are integers between -10 and 10

The relationship used:
- If roots are r₁ and r₂, then the equation is: `(x - r₁)(x - r₂) = 0`
- Expanding: `x² - (r₁ + r₂)x + (r₁ × r₂) = 0`

## 🎨 Customization

### Difficulty Levels
To modify the difficulty, adjust the root generation in `script.js`:
```javascript
// Current: roots between -10 and 10
root1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10;

// Easy: roots between -5 and 5
root1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 11) - 5;

// Hard: roots between -20 and 20
root1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 41) - 20;
```

### Styling
The project uses Tailwind CSS. Modify classes in `index.html` or add custom CSS for personalization.
